#Project Title
Group project for SMU DATA SCIENCE 2017 Summer based on BRONX data.

#Getting Started
The Department of Financeâ€™s Rolling Sales files lists properties that sold in the last twelve-month period in New York City for all tax classes. These files include the neighborhood, building type, square footage and other data.

#Related links and Prerequisites
  * <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/rolling_sales/rollingsales_bronx.xls">Bronx</a> data set.
  * <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.4.0-win.exe">R version 3.4.0</a>
  * Nice to have <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git </a> and <a href = "https://github.com/">GitHub Account</a>

#Goal
 * Create an RStudio project for the analysis of this data set. Your file structure within the
project should include the following.
  * A README file in the project root directory that includes an explanation of the purpose
of the project and the other files
  * A data directory containing files to load in and clean up the data. The clean up should
include finding out where there are outliers or missing values, deciding how you will
treat them, making sure values you think are numerical are being treated as such
(correct R class), etc.
  * An Analysis directory containing a file (or files) for exploratory data analysis on the clean
data to visualize the relationship between square footage and sales price.
