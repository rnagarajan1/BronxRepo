  * Zip Code: The property’s postal code 
  * Sales Price:Price paid for the property.

#Goal
  * To Create an RStudio project for the analysis of this data set include the following.
  * A README file in the project root directory that includes an explanation of the purpose
of the project and the other files
  * A data directory containing files to load in and clean up the data. The clean up should
include finding out where there are outliers or missing values, deciding how you will
treat them, making sure values you think are numerical are being treated as such
(correct R class), etc.
  * An Analysis directory containing a file (or files) for exploratory data analysis on the clean
data to visualize the relationship between square footage and sales price.
